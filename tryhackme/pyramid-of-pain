## 🔍 What I Learned
- The Pyramid of Pain model is a way to assess the effectiveness of detecting and blocking adversary behaviors.
- Lower-level indicators (hashes, IPs) are easier to detect but also easier for attackers to change.
- Higher-level indicators (TTPs, Tools, Techniques) cause more "pain" to attackers when defenders detect them.

## 📚 Key Takeaways
| Indicator Type        | Description                      | Pain Level |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|------------|
| Hash Values           | File fingerprints                | Low        |
| IP Addresses          | Source or destination addresses  | Low        |
| Domain Names          | Attacker infrastructure          | Medium     |
| Network/Host Artifacts| Registry keys, filenames         | Medium     |
| Tools                 | Scripts, malware families        | High       |
| Tactics/Techniques    | Attacker behavior                | Very High  |

## 🛠️ Tools Discussed
- Threat intel platforms (e.g., MISP, VirusTotal)
- SIEMs for correlation
