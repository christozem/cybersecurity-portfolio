## 🔍 What I Learned
- The Cyber Kill Chain is a 7-step model by Lockheed Martin used to track and stop adversaries early.
- It's heavily used in enterprise SOC environments for mapping threats.

## 🧩 The 7 Stages
1. **Reconnaissance** – Attacker gathers intel (emails, open ports)
2. **Weaponization** – Creates malware payload (e.g., malicious PDF)
3. **Delivery** – Sends payload (e.g., phishing)
4. **Exploitation** – Executes code on victim machine
5. **Installation** – Installs backdoor or RAT
6. **Command & Control** – Attacker gains remote access
7. **Actions on Objectives** – Data exfiltration, destruction, etc.

## 🛡️ Defensive Ideas
- Detect phishing at Delivery stage
- Block C2 at Firewall level
- Monitor endpoint behavior at Exploitation stage

## 🎯 Flag
- ✅ THM{defend_the_chain_early}
