## 🔍 What I Learned
- The Unified Kill Chain combines MITRE ATT&CK and the traditional Kill Chain for better visibility across the attack lifecycle.
- Helps align detection engineering with real-world adversary behaviors.

## 🧠 Key Components
- Maps 18 phases across 3 meta-groups: Initial Foothold, Network Propagation, and Action on Objectives.
- Extends traditional models to account for lateral movement, persistence, and privilege escalation.

## 🛠️ Use Cases
- Helps blue teams build more complete detection rules.
- Useful for red team emulation based on real APT behaviors.

## 🧠 Comparison Table

|-------|--------|-------|
| Cyber Kill Chain | 7 | Linear, Military-based |
| MITRE ATT&CK | 14 Tactics | Behavior-focused |
| Unified Kill Chain | 18 | Hybrid (Behavior + Phases) |
